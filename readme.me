In Uzbekistan, over 100,000 deaf and mute individuals face daily communication barriers, limiting their social integration. Our AI-powered app translates Uzbek sign language into text in real-time using a camera, enabling seamless interaction in hospitals, schools, and public spaces. As the first solution tailored to Uzbek sign language, it empowers deaf individuals with equal opportunities. Our goal is to fully integrate them into society and expand our app into a mobile platform. Join us in building an inclusive Uzbekistan where everyoneâ€™s voice is heard!
